# design_patterns

## Overview

- The beans layer (e.g. Employee) will interact directly with the database.
- The service layer contains business logic and interacts with the model.
- The view is responsible for interactions with the client, e.g. UI, REST API.

## DP1 - Singleton

- Restrict the client for their own good

## DP2 - Factory

- Don't touch DAO
